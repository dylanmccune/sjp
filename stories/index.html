          <p class="story-meta">Shared by Mohamed</p>
          <p class="story-text">When I was a child, I loved digging holes and being outside in the dirt. This interest came from a group of paleontologists that visited my school. Life took a turn, and I found myself on the streets. But love and support unearthed me from that place, giving me hope for the future.</p>

          <p class="story-text">I’m not the type of person who particularly desires attention. I am not here to claim the face of homelessness, but I do what I can to keep my city clean, picking up hundreds of needles every day. It’s a small way to help my community.</p>

          <p class="story-text">Ohio is where I come from. And where alcoholism came, too. I’ve been out here in San Francisco for over 20 years now. This city has been both a challenge and a home, and I keep going, one day at a time.</p>

          <p class="story-text">I grew up in San Francisco, in the Fillmore area. I’ve been in and out of prison most of my life. Last time, it was eight and a half years. Art and running helped me fight self-destruction and find a new path.</p>

          <p class="story-text">“Shhh! You know we have been robbed of our heritage and now we have to play the role of being Latinos.” I’ve never had a home of my own, which is ironic for a Native American. My journey is about reclaiming identity and belonging.</p>
